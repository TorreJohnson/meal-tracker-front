			"Beta carotene is a red-orange pigment found in plants and fruits, especially carrots and colorful vegetables. The name beta carotene comes from the Greek beta and Latin carota (carrot). It is the yellow/orange pigment that gives vegetables and fruits their rich colors. H. Wachenroder crystallized beta carotene from carrot roots in 1831, and came up with the name carotene. Beta carotene is a precursor of vitamin A. We need vitamin A for healthy skin and mucus membranes, our immune system, and good eye health and vision. Beta carotene in itself is not an essential nutrient, but vitamin A is. Vitamin A can be sourced from the food we eat, through beta carotene, for example, or in supplement form. The advantage of dietary beta carotene is that the body only converts as much as it needs. Excess vitmin A is toxic. Toxic vitamin A levels can occur if you consume too many supplements.",

One study showed that smokers with high beta carotene intake might have an increased risk of lung cancer. Some evidence suggests that beta carotene might slow cognitive decline. Beta carotene supplements interact with certain drugs, including statins and mineral oil. Beta carotene might help older people retain their lung strength as they age.",
