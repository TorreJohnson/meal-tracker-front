## Welcome to Meal Tracker!

Meal Tracker is a web app that can track micro and macro nutrients from all of the foods you eat. Simply type in the food or dish, or if you have the packaging nearby you can scan the barcode for a complete list of nutrient values and ingredients. All of your nutrient values are stored and you can see your progress over the period of 1, 7, or 30 days. You can also choose a nutritionist to help you reach your nutritional goals. Message back and forth with your nutritionist about any goals you may have.

Additionally, you can sign up as a nutritionist and set nutritional goals for your clients.
